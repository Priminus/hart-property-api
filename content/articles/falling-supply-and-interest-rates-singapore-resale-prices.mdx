# Falling Supply and Interest Rates: What It Means for Singapore Resale Prices

Over the next few years, Singapore’s residential property market is likely to look very different from the one we’ve grown accustomed to over the last decade. The shift will not be driven by sentiment alone, but by a convergence of falling interest rates, declining new supply, and structural demand—all of which increasingly favour the resale market.

## Interest rates are no longer the headwind they once were

With interest rates falling sharply from around 4.5% to closer to 1.4%, affordability dynamics are changing meaningfully. Monthly mortgage servicing costs are coming down, unlocking purchasing power for both first-time buyers and upgraders.

This is not a short-term sugar high. Lower rates sustained over several years tend to:

- Pull forward demand
- Increase acceptable price thresholds
- Encourage owner-occupiers to act rather than wait

In other words, even if buyer sentiment is already turning more positive, financial conditions are now reinforcing that behaviour.

## Supply is falling, despite improving sentiment

Here’s where the market tension emerges.

Even as demand improves, new launch supply is moving in the opposite direction. New private home launches are expected to fall from roughly 11,500 units in 2025 to about 8,400 units in 2026.

This decline is not cyclical. It reflects land scarcity and pipeline exhaustion, particularly outside the OCR. Developers can only build what land they control, and there simply isn’t much left to go around.

The implication is straightforward:

- Buyers who want certainty, immediacy, or larger living spaces will increasingly turn to resale
- Resale transactions will play a bigger role in price discovery

As a result, the long-standing pricing assumptions—such as expecting resale to lag new launches by a fixed increment (e.g. “+$50 psf per year”)—are becoming less reliable. As supply tightens, the price gap between resale and new launches is likely to compress, not expand.

## Yesterday’s “expensive” is today’s baseline

To understand how quickly market anchors shift, it’s worth recalling that just four years ago, new launch prices of $2,200–$2,400 psf in city-fringe RCR projects were widely viewed as expensive.

Fast forward to today, and those same price levels have effectively become the new normal for OCR projects.

Examples are telling:

- The Myst (District 23)
- Parktown Residences (District 18)
- The Elta (District 5)

These are not central locations by any traditional definition, yet pricing has caught up, driven by scarcity, infrastructure improvements, and buyer acceptance.

This re-anchoring matters because it:

- Supports resale price floors
- Normalises higher psf expectations across the market
- Makes well-located resale stock look increasingly attractive on a relative basis

## Upgraders remain the market’s engine

The most consistent source of demand continues to be HDB upgraders, and this is unlikely to change.

With pre-COVID interest rate conditions returning, buyers upgrading from HDBs are:

- Less constrained by financing
- More willing to prioritise liveability over pure price
- Increasingly focused on long-term hold quality

In the OCR in particular, buyers are showing a clear willingness to pay premiums for:

- Proximity to MRT stations
- Access to good schools
- Being close to family and existing support networks

This applies both to new launches and to larger resale units, which new developments increasingly struggle to supply. As unit sizes shrink in new projects, resale homes with practical layouts and space become more valuable, not less.

## AI, foreign talent, and rental support

Beyond domestic demand, there is a second structural pillar supporting prices: jobs and talent inflows.

With an estimated 65% of Southeast Asia’s AI investments flowing into Singapore, the city-state is consolidating its position as the region’s technology and innovation hub. This inevitably brings:

- High-skilled foreign professionals
- Stable, well-paid rental demand
- Support for both rental yields and capital values

This backdrop helps explain why CCR launches continue to clear strongly, despite higher price points and cooling measures. Recent results speak for themselves:

- River Green: ~88% sold on launch
- Skye at Holland: ~99% sold on launch

Looking ahead, larger leasehold developments such as Newport Residences, Sophia Meadows, and upcoming launches around Holland and Holland Link are well-positioned to benefit from the same dynamics - particularly as rental demand remains resilient.

## The bigger picture

Taken together, these forces suggest the market is entering a new phase:

- Falling interest rates improve affordability
- New supply is structurally declining
- Resale takes on greater pricing power
- Price gaps between new and resale compress
- Quality, location, and liveability matter more than ever

This is not a market set up for explosive growth, but it is one biased toward gradual repricing and resilience, especially for well-chosen resale assets.

When supply is tight, prices don’t rise evenly. Some homes will get priced higher quickly, while others are left behind. It is more paramount than ever in 2026 to select your next property with the right factors, not merely hype and past trends.
